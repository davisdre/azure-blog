Hello, I'm Drew! Welcome to my blog.

The intent of my blog is to share with you my cloud journey. I've always enjoyed everything about the cloud, specially if I don't want to run a datacenter in my home. I have the opportunity to spin things up and down at ease, and learn all the new cloud technologies are offered.

I've recently took a Cloud Administrator position at my employer. Prevsiouly I've been doing desktop support in tier 2 and tier 3 roles. 

So join me on my cloud journey where I share what I'm learning and what projects I'm working on.
