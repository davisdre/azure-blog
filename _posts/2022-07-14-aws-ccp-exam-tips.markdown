# I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner!

This is my second cloud certification and proud on my achievement in obtaining this certification. I passed the exam with an 825. I really didn't think I was going score that well because I felt confident that I passed it, but also felt I was challenged. This could be because my current employer is multi-cloud, so I work in both clouds and sometimes it’s hard to shutoff the other cloud knowledge, so it does overlap when taking my exam. At least that is how I felt. Also, my test results weren’t instant as well, so that is probably why I felt that way. I did get my results in 24 hours of taking it. 

## My exam preparation tips
Here are some of my exam-prep tips. These may not be enough for you to pass, but here is what got me through it.
- I have at least a couple years of AWS experience. Of doing a little bit here and there of projects that have come to my attention.
- I took the [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/) course. 
    - This is a free course. 
- I took the [A Cloud Guru AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner) course. 
    - This course was free to me due to my employer using their training services. You can get this course for free some months, just pay attention to A Cloud Guru blog of free courses for the month. 
- I attended a [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Days](https://aws.amazon.com/training/events/?nc2=sb_tr_evt&get-certified-vilt-courses-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.startDateSort&get-certified-vilt-courses-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.get-certified-vilt-courses-type=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-courses-series=series%23aws-essential-days&awsf.get-certified-vilt-audience=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-locations=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-countries=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-languages=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-courses-level=*all&awsf.get-certified-vilt-courses-tech-category=*all) virtual training class.
    - This was a free training. Find a day that works for you their calendar of events. 

## Takeaways from the exam

Here are some of my takeaways notes on the exam.

- As you may know already from my previous exam taking, I like taking it at a physical location. The exam proctor gave a good prep talk to the test taker to help boost confidence.
- I didn't mark as many questions for review than what I thought, but grateful there was a system built in that I can use to go back and review. 
- The questions are worded a bit tricky, most for me were like two parted questions, so pay close attention to what is being asked. 
- I am grateful for taking two different course reviews, because I believe if I solely relied on the AWS Skill builder course, I don't think I would have passed as the A Cloud Guru course find in some information that was missed in the other course. 

## Final Thoughts

Do whatever it takes for you to study and learn the material. Make sure you are doing some type of hands-on labs and/or project to help you retain some the knowledge and understanding. I am grateful this time that I took more than one course to go over the course material as it helped filled a void of information that might have been missed from the other vendor. As always, having a good support team goes a long way. Asking friends, family, and co-workers for advice on the exam or advice in studying and preparing for an exam could be helpful. 

I hope this information is helpful in your journey to getting the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.
